1.JVM based deployment

YOu need jvm

App.class => feed on to the JVM=>Starts your code.
             in->c1-c2
             in->c1-graal

App.class + aot file(helper file)
            .class+so => in -> native -c1-c2(graal)

2.Native based deployment

Aot+Grall=>native generator (native-image)

App.class/jar => native generator ===> platform binary(.exe / fileName)

  >App.exe
  >./App
